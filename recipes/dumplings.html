        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is for one of the first things I ever learned to cook, and my family's most famous dish in our community, Southern Style Chicken and Dumplings.
            It's a great warm comfort food, that is perfect at any time of the year! It pairs really well with fried chicken, or can be enjoyed on its own!
            It can also be made extremely easily, and in large quanities! Great for family get togethers or potlucks! It can be made in a more complicated way, but this is the simples method, that even someone who never cooks can follow!
