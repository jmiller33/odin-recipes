        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is one of my favorite recipes that my mom makes, an adaptation of a cheesy chicken and rice cassarole, but with a twist!
            This version is made totally in a crock pot! I love making this, because it is really easy, super flavorful, and convinient! 
            If you love cheese and chicken, this is the recipe for you.
